            <h2>Her Life</h2>

            <p>
                My mother, Chamin-Uyanga Bayarmaa, was born on July 23rd, 1981 in Darkhan, Mongolia.
                She has always been a strong and caring person who puts her family first.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout her life, she has faced many challenges, yet she has remained resilient
                and positive. Her strength and determination have shaped not only her own life,
                but also the lives of those around her.
            </p>

            <p>
                From a young age, she learned the value of hard work and responsibility,
                lessons that she continues to pass on to her children.
