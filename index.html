        <h2>My Hero, My Mother</h2>
        <p>
            This website is dedicated to my personal hero, my mother.
            Her strength, dedication, and unconditional love have shaped who I am today.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this website, I want to share her life story, her work,
            and the reasons why she is my greatest inspiration. 
        <p>
            My mother has always been the strongest person in my life. She has supported me through every challenge and has never 
            stopped believing in me, even when I doubted myself.
